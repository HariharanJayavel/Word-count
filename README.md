## ALGORITHM: 
### Step 1:
First we want to create a text file.

### Step 2: 
Use for loop to count the number of words in the file.
 
### Step 3: 
Use split() to read the splitted words.We assume that words in a sentance are separted by a space character.


### Step 4: 
The length of the split list should equal the numbers of words in the test file. 

### Step 5: 
You can refine the count by cleaning the string prior to splitting or validating the words after splitting.

### Step 6: 
End the program.
